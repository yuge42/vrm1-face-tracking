# VRM Model Directory

Place your VRM 1.0 model files in this directory.

## Getting VRM Models

You can obtain VRM models from:

- [VRoid Hub](https://hub.vroid.com/) - Community-created VRM avatars
- [VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/studio) - Create your own VRM avatars
- Other VRM-compatible tools and platforms

## Default Model

By default, the application looks for `model.vrm` in this directory. You can either:

1. Place your VRM file here and name it `model.vrm`
2. Modify the code in `src/main.rs` to load a different filename

## File Format

This application only supports **VRM 1.0** format files (`.vrm` extension).

## License Note

VRM models may have various licenses. Please respect the creator's license terms when using VRM models.
